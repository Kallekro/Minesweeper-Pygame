# Minesweeper-Pygame
I made Minesweeper in pygame

# Requirements
You need to have python 3 with pip installed. 

You do **not** need to have pygame, in which case it will be downloaded on first play.

# To play
Go to this folder in your terminal and run the game with the command
```
python3 minesweeper.py
```
